# Medi-LlaMA

Medi-LlaMA is a Hybrid AI system integrating LlaMA, knowledge graphs, and symbolic reasoning and learning. Medi-LlaMA aims to identify individual conditions predisposing patients to adverse treatment responses, empowering healthcare practitioners to prioritize safety improvement and contribute to the overarching goal of universal healthcare. Medi-LlaMA will face the following challenges.

- **Data Integration**: Combines data from clinical trials, patient records, research papers, and anecdotal reports to provide comprehensive insights.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts and processes information about disease treatments, outcomes, adverse effects, and drug interactions from a variety of clinical data sources.
- **Data Anonymization**: Ensures patient privacy and compliance with ethical standards through rigorous data anonymization and consent protocols.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Utilizes the Unified Medical System Language (UMLS) to integrate and align data into a cohesive KG, enhanced with rule-based symbolic reasoning.
- **Digital Twins**: Incorporates user profiles via digital twins to tailor responses based on individual needs, preferences, and reasoning patterns.
- **Vector Space Representation**: Creates embeddings of the Medi-LlaMA KG, learned through inductive learning and symbolic reasoning, to enhance the system's contextual understanding.
- **Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering**: Fine-tunes LlaMA with medical knowledge embeddings and enhances performance with prompt engineering based on biomedical ontologies.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Ensures accuracy and reliability through RAG using contextual knowledge extracted from digital twins and specific treatment information.

## Motivating Scenario

"I am Juan Crist√≥bal, a doctor specializing in medical oncology with more than 15 years of experience in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. I develop my work in a hospital in Madrid with more than 2,500 new cancer patients per year, among which we include more than 350 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. I would like you to answer some questions regarding the care of a 61-year-old patient, ex-smoker, hypertensive and with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed with stage IV breast carcinoma (involvement in the right breast, axillary lymph node and with multiple bone metastases), with high expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors (by immunohistochemistry both 90%), HER2 negative (0+) and Ki67: 10%, who will begin a first line of treatment with ribociclib and letrozole. I wanted to ask you if you could help me by informing me first of all what the expected benefit of the selected treatment is in terms of response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival with respect to the possible therapeutic alternatives. Secondly, anticipating what adverse effects we can expect and their probability, also considering the referred comorbidity and the concomitant medication of metformin, enalapril and amlodipine, as well as the possible drug interactions and the influence on the possible adverse effects of said interactions. Finally, I would like to know the impact of the treatment on the different known quality of life indicators, as well as the potential measures that we could consider to avoid deterioration in quality of life."

# Medi-LlaMA- Our Proposed Approach 
While these LLMs provide valuable insights, they lack the capability to personalize responses based on the user's profile, needs, reasoning style, and preferences. Additionally, they do not utilize knowledge extracted from clinical records of patients with breast cancer, which limits their ability to deliver highly contextual and relevant information.
In contrast, Medi-LlaMA stands out by exploiting an extensive knowledge base collected from medical records, scientific publications, and databases. More importantly, Medi-LlaMA can contextualize questions and prepare answers tailored to the profile of the user who prompts the question. Personalization is achieved by leveraging digital twins that encode each user's needs, preferences, and reasoning processes. This user-centric approach ensures that the information provided is not only accurate but also highly relevant and practical, enhancing decision-making processes and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

# The Medi-LlaMA Architecture
Medi-LlaMA is a Hybrid AI System that integrates knowledge graphs, and symbolic and LlaMA models.
+  **Named Entity Recognition** relies on LlaMA; annotated clinical data is utilized for prompt engineering.
+  **The Medi-LlaMA Knowledge Graph (KG)** integrates medical entities extracted from clinical data (i.e., clinical records, scientific publications, clinical trials, and biomedical databases). The KG is represented using a symbolic model (e.g., as a property graph or RDF knowledge graph) and in an n-dimensional vector space. As a result, both symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of the Medi-LlaMA KG are created.
+  **LlaMA Fine Tuning** is performed by traversing the Medi-LlaMA KG and the facts uncovered by symbolic reasoning and learning. Constrainst are validated via symbolic models (e.g., expressed in SHACL).
+  **Hybrid Prompt Answering** integrates facts collected from the Medi-LlaMA KG, represented with symbolic models and as a vector atltas, symbolic models, and the Medi-LlaMA model. The Medi-LlaMA system implements **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** to combine the output from these subsystems should be called. New facts uncovered by Medi-LlaMA model are materialized in the Medi-LlaMA KG; it can be edited and curated.
